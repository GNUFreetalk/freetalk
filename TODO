 TODO:
    
 1. Fix the bug introduced by invisible mode during freetalk to freetalk communication. 
    Gtalk to freetalk Invisible mode works properly due to some additional handling of
    gtalk client from Google.

 2. File transfer code cleanup, fix it for new jabber protocol for file transfer 
    (Atleast fix it somehow :P)

 3. Add new command like "/refresh" to get new list roster list from Jabber/Google server 
    and also atleast make it dynamic, as there is occasional hanging of the roster list 
    under invisible mode and other modes too. 

 4. Show idle if no activity on the terminal for 5 or more minutes. 

 5. Fix needed in handling of a notification of a statement "typing... " to be sent to Gtalk 
    while the user is typing some content to be sent on the terminal of freetalk.
