Freetalk is a console based Jabber client. It features a readline
interface with completion of buddy names, commands, and even ordinary
English words! Freetalk is extensible, configurable, and scriptable
through a Guile interface.

GNU Freetalk is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or later --- see the file COPYING for details.

USING FREETALK
--------------
To start with you can use Freetalk by just running 'freetalk' and
then doing /login to specify your Jabber account and password. To
avoid having to do this every time, you can put your account details
in a file called ~/.freetalk/freetalk.scm. Look at examples/freetalk.scm
to know how to do this.

There is comprehensive documentation in Info format in the doc/ directory,
which you should be able to read by saying,

$ info freetalk

If you face any problems compiling or using Freetalk, or if you have
any feedback/developer questions, feel free to post a message to
<freetalk-dev@gnu.org>.

NOTE: It has also been tested recently that, guile-1.8, freetalk-3.2 and gmail has stopped working. 
Buddy listing has been a problem, logging works. Nothing seems obvious than it suddenly stopped
working, needs further investigation. Until then development work is focussed @ freetalk python
replacement.
